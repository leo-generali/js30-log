## Raw Notes

- Data attributes in HTML when people started making their own attributes. If you want to make up an attribute, you have to add *data-* before the custom attribute.
- Event is an object full of data that describes what happened
- Key code: number associated with that key
- Attribute selector can be used with query selector
- By default *.play()* does not let you play audio over audio files. You can use the *.currentTime = 0* attribute to loop over without restraints. 
- Event listener: transitionend
- *this* references what was called against it
- Learned about:
  - Key Events
  - Playing audio
  - Transition end event
  - Animaiton end event
